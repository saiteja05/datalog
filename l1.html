        const interviewData = [
            {
                question: "What is your area of specialization?",
                answer: "My area of specialization is in cloud-native database architecture, with deep expertise in search technologies, vector databases, and AI/ML workloads on MongoDB. I help enterprise customers design scalable, performant solutions using MongoDB Atlas, particularly with advanced features like Atlas Vector Search and Text Search.",
                reasoning: "This answer is specific, confident, and uses keywords like 'Atlas Vector Search' that are central to your approved petition."
            },
            {
                question: "What special skills do you possess for this job?",
                answer: "I specialize in architecting complex search and AI solutions using proprietary MongoDB technologies like Atlas Search, vector indexing, and semantic relevance tuning. I have also contributed directly to developing internal, proprietary tooling and design patterns that enhance these capabilities for our customers.",
                reasoning: "This correctly highlights your work on proprietary tech and your contributions to internal design patterns, a key argument in your petition."
            },
            {
                question: "What do you think makes this skill special?",
                answer: "These skills are highly specialized because they combine deep database internals knowledge with advanced AI application patterns and performance benchmarking. Most architects understand either databases or search, but combining both at an expert level for Fortune 500 clients, using MongoDB’s proprietary tools, is rare and requires the extensive internal training I have received.",
                reasoning: "This clearly articulates why the *combination* of your skills is rare and not easily found in the general market, which is the core of the L-1B standard."
            },
            {
                question: "How long have you been working in this specialized field?",
                answer: "I have been working in this specialized field for over seven years. For the last year and a half at MongoDB, I have been focused specifically on applied search, AI, and architectural modernization for the company's most strategic enterprise clients.",
                reasoning: "This version is factually precise about your tenure at MongoDB (since Nov 2023) and your prior experience, which is critical for maintaining credibility."
            },
            {
                question: "Why is it important for you to travel to the U.S. for this work?",
                answer: "I am being transferred to the Bay Area to support some of our largest and most complex U.S. accounts, including Stripe, Anthropic, and Salesforce. These accounts require consistent, hands-on architectural support that cannot be delivered remotely due to the need for in-person strategy workshops and close collaboration with U.S.-based product and engineering teams.",
                reasoning: "This uses the specific account names from the internal memo to demonstrate a concrete business need for your physical presence in the U.S."
            },
            {
                question: "Is there any reason why a U.S. citizen could not perform this work?",
                answer: "Our company has found that the ramp-up time for an external hire to gain this level of product depth is approximately one year. My team in the Bay Area is facing an urgent talent shortage now. I bring project-tested expertise on our internal systems that is immediately deployable, which is essential for these high-risk accounts.",
                reasoning: "This is a perfect summary of the core L-1B argument. It combines the training time estimate from the petition with the urgency established in the internal memo."
            },
            {
                question: "Who is your current employer?",
                answer: "I am employed by MongoDB Software India Private Limited, which is the Indian subsidiary of the U.S. petitioner, MongoDB, Inc.",
                reasoning: "This is the precise and correct answer for an intracompany transfer visa, showing you understand the corporate relationship."
            },
            {
                question: "Talk me through your role and responsibilities.",
                answer: "As a Senior Solutions Architect, I serve as a senior technical advisor to our enterprise customers. I design their system architectures, run proof-of-concepts on our technology, and solve their most complex scalability, indexing, and AI-integration challenges using MongoDB's proprietary tools and methodologies.",
                reasoning: "This is a strong, concise summary of the detailed duties outlined in your support letter."
            },
            {
                question: "What formal training have you had?",
                answer: "I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. At MongoDB, I have completed extensive formal internal training on our proprietary technologies like Atlas Search and our internal sales methodologies. I also hold all four professional MongoDB certifications.",
                reasoning: "Specific, verifiable, and aligns perfectly with the claims of internal training and certifications in your petition."
            },
            {
                question: "Where are you intending to work? Tell me a bit about the company.",
                answer: "I will be working at MongoDB’s San Francisco office. MongoDB is a leading cloud database company that provides a developer-friendly, scalable database used by over 14,000 customers in 90 countries.",
                reasoning: "This is factually consistent with your offer letter and the approved petition. Using the numbers from the petition is the safest approach."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the job role you will be taking up?",
                answer: "I will be a Senior Solutions Architect within the 'Solutions Consulting, Growth NA' department.",
                reasoning: "This is the exact title and department listed in your official offer confirmation letter, ensuring complete consistency."
            },
            {
                question: "Talk me through the roles and responsibilities of the job in the U.S.",
                answer: "My primary role will be supporting major U.S. enterprise clients by designing their database deployments and leading architectural reviews. I will also be guiding their AI and search integrations using MongoDB's advanced features and coordinating with our U.S. product and engineering teams to provide direct feedback from the field.",
                reasoning: "This is a confident summary of the U.S. job duties chart in the approved petition."
            },
            {
                question: "Will you be paid by the U.S. company or through a payroll overseas?",
                answer: "I will be paid directly by the U.S. company, MongoDB, Inc., through its U.S. payroll.",
                reasoning: "Correct and unambiguous."
            },
            {
                question: "What will your annual salary be?",
                answer: "My compensation will be in U.S. Dollars. My base salary will be one hundred ninety thousand dollars, and my total on-target earnings, including commission, will be two hundred fifty-two thousand, seven hundred dollars.",
                reasoning: "This is a critical correction. This answer is factually correct per your offer confirmation. State the figures clearly in USD. Mentioning any other currency will cause significant confusion."
            },
            {
                question: "Where will you be living in the U.S.?",
                answer: "I plan to live in or near San Francisco, California, to be close to the office.",
                reasoning: "Correct and direct."
            },
            {
                question: "Who will you report to? Will they be U.S. based?",
                answer: "I will report to Ali Hussain, who is my manager in the Solutions Consulting department. He is based in the U.S.",
                reasoning: "This is a critical correction. This states the correct manager as listed on your offer letter, avoiding a major factual error."
            },
            {
                question: "What are your qualifications and work experience?",
                answer: "I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and have over seven years of experience in database technologies and enterprise architecture. For the past year and a half with MongoDB, I have been leading some of the company’s most strategic technical engagements in the APAC region.",
                reasoning: "This is a precise and confident summary of your experience mentioned across the documents."
            },
            {
                question: "How long will you be in the U.S.?",
                answer: "I intend to stay in the U.S. for the duration of my approved L-1B petition, which is initially for up to three years.",
                reasoning: "The perfect, standard answer. It shows you understand the terms and temporary nature of the visa."
            },
            {
                question: "On your DS-160, you answered 'Yes' to the question 'Have you ever been refused a U.S. Visa?' Can you explain this?",
                answer: "Yes. I answered 'Yes' because my L-1B Blanket visa application was refused on May 19th at the U.S. Consulate in Chennai. Subsequently, my employer filed this L-1B Individual petition, which was approved by USCIS. I am now applying based on this approved individual petition.",
                reasoning: "This answer demonstrates honesty and transparency. It states the facts clearly, provides the positive resolution (the approved individual petition), and shows you understand the proper procedure."
            },
            {
                question: "The record shows you were previously refused a visa. Why was it rejected?",
                answer: "Yes. The Consular Officer determined that the specialized nature of my role was complex and required a more detailed review through an individual petition, rather than the more streamlined blanket process. We followed that guidance, and USCIS has since reviewed the comprehensive case and approved this individual petition.",
                reasoning: "This answer is respectful of the previous officer's decision and frames it as a procedural matter. It confidently pivots the conversation to the positive outcome: your current, approved individual petition."
