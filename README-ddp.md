## 🎬 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Executive Overview (10 mins)
**Goal:** High-level platform introduction for C-level or VP audience

1. Start at the **Hero section**
   - "MongoDB Atlas is the developer data platform - not just a database"
   - Emphasize: multi-cloud, fully managed, built for modern apps

2. Scroll to **Platform Overview**
   - Show the integrated services diagram
   - "Everything developers need in one platform"

3. Jump to **Global Scale**
   - "Deploy anywhere, scale automatically"
   - Mention: 100+ regions across 3 clouds

4. End with **Security**
   - "Enterprise-grade from day one"
   - Highlight: compliance certifications

**Key Talking Points:**
- Unified platform reduces complexity
- Multi-cloud avoids vendor lock-in
- Developers can focus on building, not managing

### Scenario 2: Technical Deep Dive (20 mins)
**Goal:** Detailed walkthrough for engineering leadership

1. **Platform Overview** - explain each service:
   - Database: document model, ACID transactions
   - Search: full-text and vector search
   - Data Federation: query across sources
   - Charts: embedded visualizations

2. **Automation section**
   - Auto-scaling based on workload
   - Performance Advisor recommendations
   - Automated patching and upgrades

3. **Security section**
   - Network isolation (VPC peering, private endpoints)
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Fine-grained access control

4. **Developer Tools**
   - Atlas UI for management
   - CLI for automation
   - Integrations with popular frameworks

**Key Talking Points:**
- Zero operational overhead
- Built-in best practices
- Enterprise features at every tier

---

### Scenario 3: Migration Discussion (15 mins)
**Goal:** Address concerns for customers moving to Atlas

1. Start with **current state** discussion
   - Where are they running today?
   - Self-managed MongoDB or another database?

2. Show **Migration section**
   - Live migration tools
   - Sync for hybrid deployments
   - Professional services available

3. Address **concerns**:
   - "Will my app work?" → Compatible with existing drivers
   - "What about downtime?" → Live migration minimizes impact
   - "Lock-in?" → Multi-cloud and data portability

**Key Talking Points:**
- Proven migration paths
- Support available throughout
- ROI typically realized within months

## 💡 Presenter Tips

### Before the Demo
- [ ] Know your audience level (executive vs technical)
- [ ] Have specific use cases ready for their industry
- [ ] Prepare pricing discussion points if relevant
- [ ] Test the page loads smoothly

### During the Demo
- **Adapt to interests** - skip sections if they're engaged elsewhere
- **Use the navigation** - don't force linear scrolling
- **Point out interactive elements** - hover effects on cards
- **Connect to their needs** - "For your use case, this means..."

### Common Questions

**Q: How does Atlas pricing work?**
A: Pay for what you use - compute, storage, data transfer. Free tier available for development.

**Q: Can we use our existing MongoDB skills?**
A: Yes, same query language, drivers, and tools. Atlas adds managed infrastructure.

**Q: What about compliance (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)?**
A: Atlas is certified for major compliance frameworks. Dedicated clusters available for regulated workloads.

**Q: How does multi-cloud work?**
A: Deploy clusters across AWS, Azure, and GCP simultaneously. Data replicates automatically.

**Q: What if we need to leave Atlas?**
A: Your data is always yours. Export anytime. No proprietary lock-in.
